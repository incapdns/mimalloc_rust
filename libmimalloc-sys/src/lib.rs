/// When using the `"override"` feature flag, the user wants us to globally
/// override the system allocator.
///
/// However, since we build and link `mimalloc` as a static library/archive,
/// the linker may decide to not care about our overrides if it can't directly
/// see references to the symbols, see the following link for details:
/// <https://maskray.me/blog/2021-06-20-symbol-processing#archive-processing>
///
/// This is problematic if `mimalloc` is used from a library that by itself
/// doesn't allocate, yet invokes other shared libraries that do, since then
/// the linker wouldn't see any references to `malloc`/`free`, and the symbols
/// would not be overridden.
///
/// To avoid this problem, we make sure that the allocator functions are
/// visible to the linker.
///
/// To avoid this problem, we reference `mi_malloc` in a `#[used]` static.
/// This makes it known to `rustc`, which will create a reference to it in a
/// `symbols.o` stub file that is later passed directly to the linker (instead
/// of being in an archive). See the following link for details on how this
/// works: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95604>
///
/// NOTE: This works because `mimalloc` is compiled into a single object file
/// in `static.c`. If it was split across multiple files, we'd need to
/// reference each symbol. See also the comment at the top of `static.c`.
///
/// NOTE: On macOS, mimalloc doesn't just override malloc/free, but also
/// registers itself with the allocator's zone APIs in a ctor
/// (`_mi_macos_override_malloc`, marked with `__attribute__((constructor))`).
/// Similarly to above, for the Mach-O linker to actually consider ctors as
/// "used" when defined in an archive member in a static library, so we need
/// to explicitly reference something in the object file. The constructor
/// symbol itself is static, so we can't get a reference to that, so instead
/// we reference `mi_malloc` here too).
